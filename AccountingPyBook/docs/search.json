    "text": "This is a book created from a variety of Accounting textbooks used in a University degree. The goal is to make this book an all in one resource on Accounting main concepts while teaching how to use the programming language of Python to make the various accounting calculations faster and iteratively.\nMany accounting calculations are repetitive and usually one calculation ties into another calculation, which makes it very suitable for using functions that use already calculated output. Typically the Accounting world uses Microsoft Excel or proprietary software such as SAS or SPSS or others, while Python is free to use and learning the Python language is very much a valuable skill.\nOften you have accounting information stored in .xlsx files or pdf files, none of which are reproducible when you pass to a colleague or classmate. Mistakes are easy to make when working with Excel sheets, one cell can have a function but that cell’s function is not obvious and errors can happen if that cell gets altered. In Python, you can take in a xlsx or pdf file, read the data from it and run your functions to make calculations and then make a dashboard, a presentation or a web app that anyone can just go to the url and use the app.\nBy learning Python you are learning how to be more efficient with your accounting, as you write one function to calculate cost of goods sold, then you can just use that same function a million times. That function can live in one file somewhere on your computer and you can call (import) it into the current running file and still get the output you want.\nThis book will show how to make use of Python’s data objects that store data and place these into function to make our calculations repeatable. This book is a companion to the YouTube channel AccountingPy."

    "section": "1.5 Lists",
    "text": "1.5 Lists\nPython lists are very useful and are also known as arrays (when using the NumPy library).\n\ncan store various data items, duplicates are allowed which is important to know.\nLists can be empty and the values can be changed (mutable).\n\nIMPORTANT TO KNOW :\n\nevery list, dictionary, set and string all start at 0 zero not 1, start counting at 0 or use n - 1 to get the correct index value.\n\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list = ['shareholders equity',233, True,\"liabilities\", 99]\n\nprint( accounting_list )\n\n\n['shareholders equity', 233, True, 'liabilities', 99]\n\n\n\n1.5.1 Array slicing\nTo get specific elements in the array list you can use slicing. To get the 2nd item (element) from the list, remember n - 1 for index number.\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list[1]\n\n\n233\n\n\nTo get the last element in the array list, you can use -1, which means the 1st one from the end. If you wanted the second last element, -2, and so forth.\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list[-1]\n\n\n99\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Change element in list\nSay we want to change ‘liabilities’ to ‘purchases’, we use the index of element we want to change and assign the new variable.\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list[3] = \"purchases\"\naccounting_list\n\n\n['shareholders equity', 233, True, 'purchases', 99]\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Get more than 1 element\nIf you are interested in only a few or specific elements in a list you can specify the indexes of the elements of the list. In this example, we want the first to the second elements.\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list[0:3]\n\n\n['shareholders equity', 233, True]\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4 List length\nKnowing how long a list is, how many elements that are inside the list object is very useful to know for using in for loops.\n\n\nShow the code\nlen( accounting_list )\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n1.5.5 Add elements to list\nPython lists can be modified by adding to the list array. Since we store all of the elements into a variable we can use the name of the list and call functions on that variable such as .append() to add to an existing list.\nIn this example we just want to add ‘income_sheets’ to the list. Note: if you call this function more than once, Python will keep adding this one variable to the list.\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list.append(\"income_sheets\")\naccounting_list\n\n\n['shareholders equity', 233, True, 'purchases', 99, 'income_sheets']\n\n\n\n\n1.5.6 Join lists\nIf you have one list array and want to join or merge them together, you can use .extend() function.\n\n\nShow the code\nsheet1 = [\"Accounts payable\",\"debts receivable\",\"credit payable\"]\nsheet2 = [\"balance sheet\",\"assets & liabilities\"]\n\nsheet1.extend(sheet2)\n\nprint( sheet1 )\n\n\n['Accounts payable', 'debts receivable', 'credit payable', 'balance sheet', 'assets & liabilities']\n\n\n\n\n1.5.7 Delete element\nYou can delete an element from a list array, using the pop() function which by default removes the very last element in an array, but if you provide the index number it will remove that element.\nIn this example we will remove the element “True” from index 2. Note: Python will keep deleting elements from your list if this function is called repeatedly.\n\n\nShow the code\naccounting_list.pop(2)\naccounting_list\n\n\n['shareholders equity', 233, 'purchases', 99, 'income_sheets']\n\n\n\n\n1.5.8 List for loops\nfor loops are functions that will iterate over a Python object such as a list or dictionary, dataframe or even a string. For loops are important to know and are essential for becoming efficient in programming.\nIf you have a list of assets and quickly want to print them out to see what they are or perform a math function for loops are what to use.\nIn this example we want to loop through the numbers 0 to 4, and print out each number. The range() by default understands what the start and end of the range is but could be explicitly defined. If you wanted 1 to 5, range(1,6).\n\nNote: “for x in something”, the x can be named just about anything (just not a reserved word in Python).\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfor x in range(5):\n    print(x)\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nSay we have a list of a client’s assets, and we want it iterate through the list and print them. We want to know the length of the list in order to tell the for loop to stop at the end of the list, this serves 2 purposes: 1) you can modify the list (add or delete elements) and the for loop will keep working, and 2) by knowing the length of the list prevents errors when looping through a list and tries to find an element index that does not exist.\n\nrange( len( list_name ))\nindex of the loop is needed, hence client_assets[items] which goes through the list array and prints the index location value\n\n\n\nShow the code\nclient_assets = ['boat','house','fancy car','comic book collection','stocks']\n\nfor items in range( len( client_assets )):\n    print( client_assets[items] )\n\n\nboat\nhouse\nfancy car\ncomic book collection\nstocks\n\n\nUsing for loops is going to be something you will need to understand and get comfortable with in order to make your accounting more efficient.\nWhile loops will be purposefully ignored as they are very easy to mess up and crash your program. You may wish to learn them on your own but I caution you not to unless you have experience coding in Python.\n\n\n1.5.9 List sorting\nYou can sort or reverse a list, simply by calling .sort() function and .reverse() on the list variable name.\n\n\nShow the code\ncommon_assets = ['z item','investments','cash','inventory','supplies']\n\ndividends_paid = [100,1001.1,1020,101,300,301,90,9]\n\ncommon_assets.sort()\ndividends_paid.sort()\n\nprint( common_assets )\nprint( dividends_paid )\n\n\n# reverse\ndividends_paid.reverse()\nprint( dividends_paid )\n\n\n['cash', 'inventory', 'investments', 'supplies', 'z item']\n[9, 90, 100, 101, 300, 301, 1001.1, 1020]\n[1020, 1001.1, 301, 300, 101, 100, 90, 9]"

If you later want to make a data dictionary a dataframe, you can with the help of the Pandas library. Once you have a dataframe created or converted from a data dictionary you can save it as a CSV or other formats.\nData dictionaries are ordered, mutable and have keys and value pairs (‘key’ : ‘value’).\n\ndictionaries do not allow duplicates of keys\ndictionaries are not indexed, grab elements by key or value\nit is good practice to Pascal_Case or CamelCase your keys (also with everything) as it will help with tab-auto complete and grabbing the key you want\n\nIn this example we have some financial information of assets.\n\n\nShow the code\nall_assets = {\n  \"cash\": 3098772.89,\n  'inventory': 7886.23,\n  \"supplies\": 56234.56,\n  \"prepaid_expenses\": 14521\n}\n\n\n\n1.8.1 select key\nIn this example we want to get the value for cash, so we slice the dictionary and use the key name to get the value.\n\n\nShow the code\nall_assets['cash']\n\n\n3098772.89\n\n\n\n\n1.8.2 dictionary length\nFind out how many elements are in a data dictionary\n\n\nShow the code\nlen(all_assets)\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n1.8.3 all items\nIf you wanted to print out all the items in a dictionary, use .items() function\n\n\nShow the code\nall_assets.items()\n\n\ndict_items([('cash', 3098772.89), ('inventory', 7886.23), ('supplies', 56234.56), ('prepaid_expenses', 14521)])\n\n\n\n\n1.8.4 dictionary keys\nIf you want to know the keys for the dictionary in order to use them for a function, use the .keys() function.\n\n\nShow the code\nall_assets.keys()\n\n\ndict_keys(['cash', 'inventory', 'supplies', 'prepaid_expenses'])\n\n\n\n\n1.8.5 modify a key\nIf the key has a value that needs to be changed, you can use the slice and key name method and assign a new value.\nIn this example we will give a new value for the property key.\n\n\nShow the code\nall_assets['property'] = 788655\nall_assets.items()\n\n\ndict_items([('cash', 3098772.89), ('inventory', 7886.23), ('supplies', 56234.56), ('prepaid_expenses', 14521), ('property', 788655)])\n\n\n\n\n1.8.6 dictionary values\nIf you just wanted to see the values stored in a dictionary, use the .values() function.\n\n\nShow the code\nall_assets.values()\n\n\ndict_values([3098772.89, 7886.23, 56234.56, 14521, 788655])\n\n\n\n\n1.8.7 check dictionary\nIf we had a large dictionary and quickly wanted to check if a specific key exists inside the dictionary, we can use a if statement with in dictionary_name.\nIn this example we will search if “supplies” exists in the all_assets.\n\n\nShow the code\nif \"supplies\" in all_assets:\n  print(\" 'supplies' was found in the dictionary\" )\n\n\n 'supplies' was found in the dictionary\n\n\n\n\n1.8.8 dictionary for loops\nAs mentioned previously, for loops are very much part of programming, you want to iterate over a list or some data object and do some sort of action along the process. We can iterate over a data dictionary to see what a specific client has for assets and by type.\nIn this example we will loop through all assets and show that the client is Dunder Mifflin’s assets by type of category.\n\n\nShow the code\nfor DunderMifflin in all_assets:\n  print(f\"Dunder Mifflin assets $ { all_assets[ DunderMifflin]} [{DunderMifflin}]\")\n\n\nDunder Mifflin assets $ 3098772.89 [cash]\nDunder Mifflin assets $ 7886.23 [inventory]\nDunder Mifflin assets $ 56234.56 [supplies]\nDunder Mifflin assets $ 14521 [prepaid_expenses]\nDunder Mifflin assets $ 788655 [property]\n\n\n\n\n1.8.9 dictionary copy\nOnce you have a data dictionary, you can make a copy as to make sure you have a safe copy from any deletions or whatever may be the case. You can make copies for a client each quarter and only need to modify a few items instead of starting from scratch. To make a copy of a dictionary, use the .copy() function.\nIn this example we will make a copy of all_assets and with the new copy we will create a new element and append it to the dictionary.\n\n\nShow the code\nprint(f\" Original: {all_assets}\\n\")\n\nassets_2 = all_assets.copy()\n\nprint(f\" Copy: {assets_2}\\n\")\n\nassets_2['yacht'] = 1086777\n\nprint(\"....\", assets_2, '\\n')\n\n\n Original: {'cash': 3098772.89, 'inventory': 7886.23, 'supplies': 56234.56, 'prepaid_expenses': 14521, 'property': 788655}\n\n Copy: {'cash': 3098772.89, 'inventory': 7886.23, 'supplies': 56234.56, 'prepaid_expenses': 14521, 'property': 788655}\n\n.... {'cash': 3098772.89, 'inventory': 7886.23, 'supplies': 56234.56, 'prepaid_expenses': 14521, 'property': 788655, 'yacht': 1086777}"

    "text": "1.10 Functions\nFunctions are so important to know! Functions will help you be more efficient and more productive.\nIf you are doing a task more than 3 times, it is wise to make that task into a function. Accounting has so many mundane routine calculations that learning to make functions will make accounting faster.\n\nIn Python, a function starts with def followed by a function name you provide, () then a : and your code is indented underneath the ‘def function_name():’\nInside the function_name( arguments ) . These arguments are what you pass into the function, you can pass in an array or a dictionary . You do not have to pass in anything.\n\nNote: in many Python documentation guides you will see ‘func’ for naming a function, along with ‘foo’ and ‘bar’\nLet us create a simple function that prints out a message.\n\n\nShow the code\n#-------------------- function block\ndef my_function():\n  \n  print(\"Hi, my first function!\")\n  \n#-------------------- \n\n#- outside of the function block\n#- call your function by typing the name of it\nmy_function()\n\n\nHi, my first function!\n\n\nIndentation matters when dealing with conditionals and functions, you will get errors if your code is not properly indented.\n\n1.10.1 Function with argument\nOnce you get the handle of how functions work and how to call them, next is to pass in the function a argument, a data object or a string that is then used by the function. Just like in math textbooks f(x) you pass in x as a number then the “f” function makes a calculation.\nIn this example we will pass in job in the function “()” where function arguments go.\n\n\nShow the code\ndef my_function( job ):\n  print(f\"your job is {job}\")\n  \n\n# call the function and pass in a argument\nmy_function(\"Accounting\")\n\n\nyour job is Accounting\n\n\nAs the function exists you could pass in a number or another data type object, you will want to make your functions explicitly define what data type is expected for the argument as to avoid errors.\n\n\n1.10.2 function net income\nThis function will be calculating the net income, but this time the arguments in the function will be explicitly defined as int meaning integer data types. Passing in a float would still work as it is type numeric.\n\nyou can enforce data types into your arguments so if you want only numeric values and not strings to be entered into your function, use arg_name : int , arg_name : float. This helps reduce code errors.\nif you type: net_income(expenses= “900”, revenue=78) == ERRORS\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndef net_income(revenue: int, expenses: int):\n    # formula for net income\n    net = revenue - expenses\n    \n    print(f\"Net (loss) income = $ {net}\")\n    \n    \n#-- outside function block\nnet_income(revenue= 187568, expenses= 167812)\n\n\nNet (loss) income = $ 19756\n\n\nWhen calling the function you do not have to type the argument, just the value it is expecting, however it is good to type what arguments you are using for a function.\n\n\n1.10.3 Function with a list\nWe can make a function that will loop through the list and then print out when the item was checked.\nThis example will have a list of common assets which will be passed in the function number_crunch as an argument. The for loop will start from length of list -1, as Python is zero indexed.\n\n\nShow the code\ndef number_crunch( assets ):\n  \n  L = len(assets)\n  print(f\"Number of assets = {L}\\n\")\n  \n  #--------------------------- for loop\n  for wealth in assets:\n    print(f\" {wealth} ... checked\")\n  #---------------------------\n  \n#--\ncommon_assets = ['investments','cash','yacht','cabin','vacation home']\n\nnumber_crunch( common_assets )\n\n\nNumber of assets = 5\n\n investments ... checked\n cash ... checked\n yacht ... checked\n cabin ... checked\n vacation home ... checked\n\n\n\n\n1.10.4 Function with a dictionary\nAs mentioned in the dictionary section, dictionaries are very pliable data objects and are great as an option to store data. Data dictionaries are very similar to JSON data objects, so it is helpful to be used to working with them and passing them into functions.\nThis book will heavily use data dictionaries for function arguments, these function will pull values from specified keys to be used in calculations.\nIn this example we will have a dictionary for assets which will be passed in the function the_count.\n\n\nShow the code\nassets = {\n    \"cash\": 300322.78,\n    \"inventory\": 7886.23,\n    \"supplies\": 56234.56,\n    'prepaid expenses': 14560\n} \n\n\ndef the_count( acc_dict ):\n    \n    #------ convert dictionary to a list\n    dict_list = list( acc_dict.values() )\n    #-- for loop of values\n    for num in dict_list:\n        print(num)\n    \n    # sum the assets\n    s = sum( dict_list )\n    print(\"sum of assets = $ {:,}\".format(s))\n\n# use the assets dictionary from above \n\nthe_count( assets )\n\n\n300322.78\n7886.23\n56234.56\n14560\nsum of assets = $ 379,003.57\n\n\nThis function used a few tricks, the dictionary argument was converted to a list data object, which stores the dictionary values. Once the dictionary list was created and had all the values, a for loop was used to iterate over the list. The dictionary list was then summed using the sum() function and stored in a variable ‘s’ and printed out.\nThe conversion of a data dictionary to a list is needed for any future looping, you can’t loop through a dictionary."

I include it as a means of showing that you can bundle all of the functions in one file and then extract the specific functions you need. You need to understand how functions work and be comfortable with them before you attempt to work with classes. A class object has inheritance, it can store a data object(s), have multiple functions (which are called methods inside a class) and can be imported to another file.\nClass objects start with a capital letter, this is convention and is to signify that this is a class and not a regular function. I will show what a simple class object looks like, but will let you learn more about them on your own.\n\n\nShow the code\nclass Simple_class:\n  def __init__(self, name, age): # class self referencing arguments\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age    # self.name = name  declares the argument \n        \n  # class property\n  class_property = \"simple_class: property value\"\n    \n  #-- class method\n  def number(self):\n    x= 1898\n    print(x)\n    \n    \n# ----- important\n# similar to calling functions but this is called INSTANTIATE or \n# creating an OBJECT INSTANCE of the class\n\nobj = Simple_class(\"Python\", 28) # pass in values for class arguments\n\n# now that there is an object we can get properties from the class\nobj.class_property\n\n\n'simple_class: property value'\n\n\nCall the class method number() to get a number\n\n\nShow the code\nobj.number()\n\n\n1898\n\n\nTo aid in understanding, Python has a library called Math (comes with Python installation) and it has many math functions that you would typically want to use. When you want to square root a number you need to use Math.sqrt(), the square root function is inside the class called Math. In order to have access to this math function or any other you need to import the library into your python file. The “obj.number()” is same type of code used to get the math function from the class Math.\nClass inheritance is the next thing to learn when learning about class objects, which is not the focus of this book. As shown, class objects are very helpful for storing multiple or doing multiple things at once."

Say there is a company that makes hoverboards (like the ones in Back to the Future movie series), the following is the manufacturing costs.\n\nmaterial cost ($30) per board\nlabor costs ($40) per board\ndepreciation on factory equipment ($25,000 per year)\nproperty taxes on factory building ($6,000 per year)\nadvertising costs ($30,000 per year)\nmaintenance salaries ($45,000 per year)\nsalary of plant manager ($70,000)\ncost of shipping boards ($18 per board)\n\nWe will use a data dictionary for storing the values from above. Then, let us make a function to calculate all of the costs.\n\n\nShow the code\nhoverboards = {\n  'material_cost' : 30,\n  'labor_cost' : 40,\n  'depreciation_equipment': 25e3, # 25,000\n  'property_tax_bldg': 6e3,       # 6,000\n  'advertising_cost': 30e3,\n  'maint_salaries': 45e3,\n  'salary_plant_manager': 70e3,\n  'shipping_cost': 18\n}\n\n\nMake a function to calculate the total manufacturing costs. This function’s argument will use the data type dictionary as input for our calculations. The second thing we want to know is how many hoverboards were made? We can get user input for a number, as this makes the function flexible for future use.\n\n\nShow the code\ndef manufacturing_costs(dict , num_boards: int ):\n  manuf_costs = (dict['material_cost'] * num_boards) + (dict['labor_cost'] * num_boards) + \\\n                 dict['depreciation_equipment'] + dict['property_tax_bldg'] + \\\n                 dict['maint_salaries'] + dict['salary_plant_manager']\n                 \n  cost_per_unit = manuf_costs / num_boards\n                 \n  print(\"\\nTotal manufacturing costs = ${:,}\".format(manuf_costs))\n  print(\"\\tcost per unit is = ${:.2f}\".format(cost_per_unit))\n\n\nNow we call our function and say as that there were 10,000 hoverboards made.\n\n\nShow the code\nmanufacturing_costs(hoverboards, num_boards= 10e3)\n\n\n\nTotal manufacturing costs = $846,000.0\n    cost per unit is = $84.60"

    "text": "2.2 Cost Behavior Analysis\nThe cost behavior analysis is the study of how specific costs respond to changes in the level of business activity. Start from determining the key business activities such as:\n\nsales in dollars\nkilometers or miles driven\nquantity of service or product sold\n\nActivity level changes or volume of activity should be correlated with changes in costs. Activity Index is the activity that causes changes in the behavior costs.\n\nvariable costs = costs that vary in total, directly and proportionally with changes in the activity level. A variable cost is also defined as a cost that remains the same per unit at every level of activity. Variable costs include:\n\ndirect materials\ndirect labor for a manufacturer\ncosts of goods sold\nsales commissions\nfreight shipping\ngasoline for vehicles or planes\n\n\nif level increases by 10% :\n   total variable costs increases by 10%\n   \nif level of activity decrease by 25%:\n   total variable costs decrease by 25%\nFor example, a company’s variable cost is $10 for a camera inside the device. The activity index is the number of devices produced, say 2,000 are made. As each device is made, the total cost of each device increases by $10.\n\n\nShow the code\nvariable_cost = 10\nactivity_index = 2000\n\ndef total_variable_cost(var_cost, act_index):\n  total_var_cost = var_cost * act_index\n  print(\"Total variable costs = ${:,}\".format(total_var_cost))\n  \ntotal_variable_cost(variable_cost, activity_index)\n\n\nTotal variable costs = $20,000\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Fixed costs\nFixed costs are costs that remain the same in total within the relevant range, regardless of activity level. These include:\n\nproperty taxes\ninsurance\nrent\nsupervisory salaries\ndepreciation on buildings\nequipment\n\nif volume increases:\n  unit cost declines\n  \nif volume decreases:\n  unit cost increases\nA company leases its production facility at a cost of $10,000 per month the total fixed costs of the facility will stay constant at every level of activity. Let us make a function to calculate the unit costs.\n\n\nShow the code\nactivity_index = 2000\nlease_cost = 10e3\n\ndef unit_costs( act_index: int, lease_cost:int):\n  unit_cost = lease_cost / act_index \n  print(\"unit costs = ${:.2f}\".format(unit_cost))\n  \nunit_costs(activity_index, lease_cost)\n\n\nunit costs = $5.00\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Mixed costs\nMixed costs are costs that have both a variable element and a fixed element, semi-variable costs. Mixed costs change in total but not proportionally with changes in the activity level.\nvehicle rental company has mixed cost, assume a 5 m truck rented, plus the insurance is $50 per day, then an additional 25 cents per km.\n\nfixed cost = $50\nvariable cost = 0.25\n\nUsing a for loop you can see what the starting mixed costs are, starting with the $50 rental and 0 kilometers, to 600 kilometers.\n\n\nShow the code\nfixed_cost = 50\nvariable_cost = 0.25\nkms_driven = range(600)\ntotal = []\n\nfor x in kms_driven :\n  c = (x * variable_cost ) + fixed_cost\n  total.append(c)\n\nprint(f\"Start of total costs = $ {total[1:5]}\")\nprint(f\"End of total costs = $ {total[-5:-1]}\")\n\n\nStart of total costs = $ [50.25, 50.5, 50.75, 51.0]\nEnd of total costs = $ [198.75, 199.0, 199.25, 199.5]\n\n\nThe variable cost rises as the kilometers increase, but the fixed cost stays the same.\n\n\n2.2.3 Classifying costs\nMixed costs need to be classified into their respective fixed and variable elements. The standard method is to determine the variable cost and fixed cost of the total cost at the end of a time period. By using past experience to inform the future in cost classifications. One approach is called high-low method, but other approaches are scatter plots and least squares analysis.\nThe High-Low method uses costs incurred at the high and low activity levels, the difference in costs between the high and low is the variable costs.\n\nvariable cost per unit = \\(\\Delta\\) in total costs / \\(\\Delta\\) in activity levels\n\nUsing a transportation company, data on its buses as an example :\n\n\n\nmonth\nkms driven\ntotal cost $\n\n\n\n\nJan\n40,000\n30,000\n\n\nFeb\n80,000\n48,000\n\n\nMar\n70,000\n49,000\n\n\nApril\n100,000\n63,000\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntransport_co = {\n  'costs_high' : 63e3,\n  'costs_low' : 30e3,\n  'high_level': 100e3,\n  'low_level' : 40e3\n}\n\n\ndef var_CostPerUnit( dict ):\n  \n  delta_costs = dict['costs_high'] - dict['costs_low']\n  delta_activity = dict['high_level'] - dict['low_level']\n  \n  vcpu = delta_costs / delta_activity\n  print(\"Total variable cost per unit = ${:.2}\".format(vcpu))\n  \n  tot_fix_cost_h = dict['costs_high'] - (dict['high_level'] * vcpu)\n  tot_fix_cost_l = dict['costs_low'] - (dict['low_level'] * vcpu)\n  \n  print(\"\\n----- Maintenance costs ------\")\n  print(\"Total fixed cost (high activity) = ${:.2f} + ${:.2f} per km\".format(tot_fix_cost_h, vcpu))\n  print(\"Total fixed cost (low activity) = ${:.2f} +  ${:.2f} per km\\n\".format(tot_fix_cost_l, vcpu))\n  \n\nvar_CostPerUnit( transport_co )\n\n\nTotal variable cost per unit = $0.55\n\n----- Maintenance costs ------\nTotal fixed cost (high activity) = $8000.00 + $0.55 per km\nTotal fixed cost (low activity) = $8000.00 +  $0.55 per km"

    "text": "3.1 Cost Accounting Systems\nCost accounting involves the measuring, recording and reporting of product costs. Using this data companies can determine the total cost and the unit cost per product. This information determines the quantity of products to produce and what price to charge. Cost ccounting system contains the accounts for various manufacturing costs, part of this system is the perpetual inventory system (updated data).\nTypes of cost accounting systems:\n\njob-order cost system - costs are assigned to each job to each group of goods\nprocess cost system - costing accumulates product-related costs for a period of time, instead of costs assigned to specific products or job orders\njob-order cost flow - tracks the direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Accumulating the manufacturing costs incurred and assigning the accumulated costs to work done\n\nRaw materials cost, the cost of materials received after purchase and is now in inventory, this cost is debited for invoice cost and freight costs that are charged to purchaser. This example shows a purchase order for 2000 items, the cost for the order ($10,000) then the cost per unit is calculated. This process is the same for another purchase order and all of the data is stored in a list array.\n\n\nShow the code\nitem_quantity = [2000, 800]\norder_cost = [10e3, 32e3]\n\ncost_per_unit = order_cost[0] / item_quantity[0]\nprint(f\"The cost per unit = ${cost_per_unit} (item 1)\")\n\ncost_per_unit_2 = order_cost[1] / item_quantity[1]\nprint(f\"The cost per unit = ${cost_per_unit_2} (item 2)\")\n\ntotal_costs = sum(order_cost)\nprint(f\"Total costs for raw materials = ${total_costs}\")\n\n\nThe cost per unit = $5.0 (item 1)\nThe cost per unit = $40.0 (item 2)\nTotal costs for raw materials = $42000.0\n\n\nFor more real world examples you would use a dataframe and/or a for loop to divide the cost by quantity to determine the cost per unit.\nFactory labor costs:\n\nthe gross earnings of factory workers\nemployer payroll taxes on earnings\nfringe benefits such as sick pay, vacation pay, etc.\n\nLabor cost example, a company incurs $32,000 labor costs, subtract 27,000 for wages payable, and subtract 5,000 for payroll taxes on some day in January.\nWork in process inventory example\n\n\n\ncost\njob 1\njob n\n\n\n\n\ndirect materials\n$6000\n3600\n\n\ndirect labor\n$4000\n2000\n\n\nmanuf. overhead\n$5000\n2500\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nraw_materials = sum([6000,3600])\nfactory_labor = sum([4000,2000])\nmanuf_overhead = sum([5000,2500])\n\nprint(\"\\t           -- Debit - | -- Credit --\")\nprint(f\"Raw materials ...... {raw_materials} | {raw_materials}\")\nprint(f\"Factory labor ...... {factory_labor} | {factory_labor}\")\nprint(f\"Manufact. overhead   {manuf_overhead} | {manuf_overhead}\")\n\n\n               -- Debit - | -- Credit --\nRaw materials ...... 9600 | 9600\nFactory labor ...... 6000 | 6000\nManufact. overhead   7500 | 7500\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Manufacturing overhead costs\nManufacturing overhead costs - these costs can be accounted for daily or periodically - may aggregate the indirect materials and indirect labor\nA summary table records the property taxes, depreciation and insurance periodically. Debits are made to work in process inventory and credits are made to raw materials inventory, factory labor and manufacturing overhead.\n\nactual activity base used x predetermined overhead rate => assign to work in process\npredetermined overhead rate = estimated annual overhead costs / expected annual operating activity. The relationship between the estimated annual overhead costs and the expected annual operating activity (activity base).\nactual costing system is where the overhead rate is made after a year to get the full and actual cost\n\nUsing the direct labor cost as activity base, divide the expected overhead costs by direct labor to get the overhead rate.\n\n\nShow the code\nannual_overhead_costs = 280e3\ndirect_labor_costs = 350e3\noverhead_rate = annual_overhead_costs /direct_labor_costs\nprint(\"Overhead rate = {:.2f}%\".format(overhead_rate *100))\nprint(f\"... for every $1 of direct labor, {overhead_rate*100} cents will go to the assigned job\")\n\n\nOverhead rate = 80.00%\n... for every $1 of direct labor, 80.0 cents will go to the assigned job\n\n\nNormal costing system is tracking the direct costs (material and labor) to a cost object by using actual cost data during the accounting period. The result is assigning indirect costs (overhead) based on the predetermined rate times the actual quantity of activity base used.\n\n\n3.1.2 Costing Example\nA door manufacturer uses a job cost system and applies overhead to production on basis of direct labor cost. The predetermined overhead rate for 2016 was estimated at $24 million, and direct labor costs to be 20 million dollars.\n\n\n\ncosts\namount\n\n\n\n\ndirect materials\n$30,000,000\n\n\ndirect labor cost\n$21,000,000\n\n\nfactory insurance\n$500,000\n\n\nindirect labor\n$7,500,000\n\n\nmaintenance\n$1,000,000\n\n\nbuilding rent\n$11,000,000\n\n\ndepreciation, equipment\n$2,000,000\n\n\n\nBalance sheet\n\n\n\nmanufacturing status\nJan 1, 2016\nDec 31, 2016\n\n\n\n\nwork in process\n5,000,000\n4,000,000\n\n\nfinished goods\n13,000,000\n11,000,000\n\n\n\n\nduring 2016, the cost sheet showed a total cost of $100,000, company prices its product at 50% above its cost\n\n\n\nShow the code\nannual_costs=24e6 \ndirect_labor_costs=20e6\n\noverhead_rate = annual_overhead_costs /direct_labor_costs\n\njob_cost = 100e3\nmarkup_percentage = 0.5\nprofit = job_cost * markup_percentage\n\nmanufacture = {\n  \"direct_materials\" : 30e6,\n  \"direct_labor_cost\": 21e6,\n  \"factory_insurance\": 500e3,\n  \"indirect_labor\" : 7_500_000,\n  \"maintenance\": 1e6,\n  \"building_rent\" : 11e6,\n  \"depreciation_equipment\": 2e6\n}\n\nwork_in_process = [5e6, 4e6]\nfinished_goods = [13e6, 11e6]\n\nactual_manuf_overhead = manufacture['factory_insurance']+ \\\n                        manufacture['indirect_labor']+ \\\n                        manufacture['maintenance'] +\\\n                        manufacture['building_rent'] +\\\n                        manufacture['depreciation_equipment']\n                        \napplied_overhead_cost = manufacture['direct_labor_cost'] * overhead_rate\nover_applied_overhead= actual_manuf_overhead - applied_overhead_cost\n\ntotal_manuf_costs = manufacture['direct_materials'] + manufacture['direct_labor_cost'] + applied_overhead_cost\n\ntot_cost_process = total_manuf_costs + work_in_process[0]\ncogsm = tot_cost_process - work_in_process[1]\n\ncogs_avail_4sale = finished_goods[0] + cogsm \ncogsun = cogs_avail_4sale - finished_goods[1]\ncogs = cogsun + over_applied_overhead\n\n\nThe printed output.\n------- Cost Accounting --------\nOverhead rate = 120.00%\nActual manufacturing overhead .. $22,000,000.0\nApplied overhead cost .......... $25,200,000.0\nOver applied overhead .......... $-3,200,000.0\nTotal manufacturing costs ........... $76,200,000.0\nTotal cost of work in process ....... $81,200,000.0\nCost of goods manufactured .......... $77,200,000.0\nCost of goods available for sale ............ $90,200,000.0\nCost of goods sold (unadjusted) ............. $79,200,000.0\nCost of goods sold .......................... $76,000,000.0\n\nPrice to customer = $150,000.0 (Profit: $50,000.0)"

    "text": "4.1 Process Cost Systems\nManufacturing process cost systems is to apply costs to similar products that are mass produced in a continuous way.\nSimilarities and differences between job order and process cost systems is that costs are tracked through the series of manufacturing processes and not by individual jobs.\nJob order cost flow:\n\ndirect materials, labor, manufacturing overhead\nwork in process inventory\nfinished goods inventory\ncost of goods sold\n\nProcess cost flow:\n\ndirect materials, labor, manufacturing overhead\nwork in process (department A)\nwork in process (department B)\nfinished goods inventory\ncost of goods sold\n\nThe similarities of job order cost and process cost systems, are manufacturing cost elements, both have costing systems track materials, labor and overhead. The accumulation of the costs of materials, labor and overhead are all debited costs. Lastly, the flow of costs are debited in both costing system but the methods used do differ between them.\nThe differences are the number of work in process accounts used, job order costing uses only one process account. The documents used to track costs, as process costs system summarizes the costs in a production cost report for each department and job cost systems tally individual jobs then sums the cost in a cost sheet when the job is finished. The process cost system the unit cost is the total manufacturing costs for the period divided by the units produced during the period, unlike job cost system job cost divided by units produced.\n\nOperating costs is the hybrid approach using both process cost and job order cost systems."

Factory labor is debited when costs are incurred, and likewise for debit overhead costs.\n\nAll raw materials used for production are the material costs\ntime tickets could be used in a factory labor cost for process cost system\nmanufacturing overhead costs can be determined by looking at the machine time used (not direct labor), as this provides a clear overhead cost.\n\n\n4.2.1 Proccess costing example\nA company makes a generic beverage, using two processes such as blending and bottling. In June the raw materials used cost $18,000 for blending and 4,000 dollars for bottling. Factory labor costs were $12,000 for blending, 5,000 for bottling. Manufacturing overhead costs were 6,000 dollars for blending and 2500 dollars for bottling. Units completed at a cost of 19,000 dollars in the blending department transferred to bottling department.

This example company makes breakfast pancakes which has different departments.\n\n4.3.1 Physical flow\nPhysical units are the actual units to be accounted for during a period, regardless of any work performed. To keep track of these units, add units that got started or transferred into production during the time period, these units are called total units to be accounted for.\nUsing a nested list that has 2 data dictionaries to hold data about the company’s mixing department. This data object looks like a JSON data object, you can convert nested lists into dataframes but we will just use this nested list for the functions as this is flexible and looks similar to a Excel spreadsheet (in a way).\nNormally we have seen simple dictionaries where there is a single key and a value pair, but here we have a list that stores 2 dictionaries, each which has a single key then the value is a dictionary instead of a single value. To access elements from a nested list array and get items from a dictionary, you need to slice the list, then specify which dictionary key, then the name of the nested dictionary key to get the value.\n\nmixing_data has 2 elements which are both dictionaries [ {}, {} ], remember zero index\nname the dictionary key [0]['units']\nname the nested dictionary key [0]['units']['wip_start'] to get the value\n\n\n\nShow the code\nmixing_data = [\n  {\n    'units': {\n        'wip_start': 100e3,                   # June 1\n        'direct_materials_percent': 1,\n        'conversion_costs_percent': 0.70,\n        'units_in_production': 800e3,\n        'units_completed_transferred': 700e3,\n        'wip_end':200e3,                       # June 30\n        'wip_end_materials_percent': 1,\n        'wip_end_conversion_costs_percent':  0.60\n      }\n    },\n    {\n    'costs': {\n        'wip_start_direct_materials': 50e3,\n        'wip_start_conversion_costs': 35e3,\n        'cost_wip_start': 85e3,\n        'costs_direct_materials': 400e3,\n        'costs_conversion_costs': 170e3,\n        'costs_incurred': 570e3\n      }  \n    }\n]\n\n\nPhysical unit flow calculation\n\n\nShow the code\ndef physical_flow( mixing_data= list):\n  \n  # units to be accounted for = wip_start + started_transferred\n  tot_units = mixing_data[0]['units']['wip_start'] + mixing_data[0]['units']['units_in_production']\n  \n  # units accounted for = completed_transferred + wip_end\n  units_acc = mixing_data[0]['units']['units_completed_transferred'] + mixing_data[0]['units']['wip_end']\n  \n  print(\"-- Physical Unit Flow --\")\n  print(\"Total units accounted for  \",\".\"*5,\"{:,}\".format(tot_units))\n  print(\"Total units   \", \".\"*18,\"{:,}\".format(tot_units))\n  \n\nphysical_flow(mixing_data)\n\n\n-- Physical Unit Flow --\nTotal units accounted for   ..... 900,000.0\nTotal units    .................. 900,000.0\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Equivalent units: Production\nAfter determining the physical flow of units next step is to measure the department’s productivity in equivalent units of production.

By knowing Python you can extend these skills to using libraries such as python-docx which makes and reads Word Documents. Once you know Python you can usually type in Google or any other web search engine for “python + search terms” and will get results. Python code now is what you are seeing, but on your own you can make your python files into reproducible professional documents, dashboards and even web apps.\n\nSince each of the steps has already been calculated above using functions, we can just copy our call our functions and get the output of the calculations.\n\n\nShow the code\nprint(\"-- PRODUCTION COST REPORT --\")\nprint('')\nphysical_flow(mixing_data)\nprint('')\nequivalent_units(mixing_data)\nprint('')\nproduction_costs( mixing_data)\nprint('')\ncost_reconciliation(mixing_data)\n\n\n-- PRODUCTION COST REPORT --\n\n-- Physical Unit Flow --\nTotal units accounted for   ..... 900,000.0\nTotal units    .................. 900,000.0\n\n-- Equivalent Units --\nEquivalent units (materials) =  ............ 900,000.0\nEquivalent units (conversion costs) =  ..... 820,000.0\n\n-- Unit Production Costs --\nTotal materials costs   ............... $450,000.0\nUnit materials cost   ................. $0.5\n\nTotal conversion costs  ............... $205,000.0\nUnit conversion costs   ................. $0.25\nTotal manufacturing cost per unit   ..... $0.75\n\nCost reconciliation schedule   ..... $655,000.0\n\n-- Cost Reconciliation --\nTotal costs charged to department =  ..... $655,000.0\n\n\nThe wonderful thing about functions is that you spend the time making them, but once you do you benefit from it.

    "text": "5.1 The ABC system\nThe amount of direct labor used in industries has changed with decreased, and the total overhead costs such as: depreciation on equipment, machinery, utilities, repairs and maintenance has increased. The ABC system uses machine hours as foundation for determining overhead costs, but this may not be precise enough for accurate costing for some industries where the manufacturing process is complicated, thus there is activity based costing. The ABC is a method for allocating overhead costs for specific activities then assigns these costs to products and services using costing drivers.\n\nactivity is any event, transaction or work sequence that incurs a cost during production\nactivity cost pool is a unique activity like ordering materials or machinery setting up\ncost driver any activity that has a direct cause-effect relationship with resources consumed\n\n\nIf there is no or little correlation between changes in the cost driver and the consumption of the overhead cost, then inaccurate product costs will result\n\n\n5.1.1 ABC example\nA company produces two items, item 1 is a high volume item totalling 25,000 units annually. The second item is a low volume item totalling only 5,000 units per year. Each product requires 1 hour of direct labor to complete. Expected annual manufacturing overhead costs are $900,000.\n\n\nShow the code\nhigh_vol_item = 25e3\nlow_vol_item = 5e3\nexpect_overhead = 900e3\n\ntotal_annual_direct_labor = high_vol_item + low_vol_item\n\npred_overhead_rate = expect_overhead / total_annual_direct_labor\n\nprint(\"Total annual direct labor hours = {:,}\".format(total_annual_direct_labor))\nprint(\"Predetermined overhead rate \\n(traditional costing) = ${:,} per labor hr\".format(pred_overhead_rate))\n\n\nTotal annual direct labor hours = 30,000.0\nPredetermined overhead rate \n(traditional costing) = $30.0 per labor hr\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 ABC step 1\nThis example company has three activity cost pools: setting p machine, machining and inspecting. All overhead costs directly associated with machine setting up (salaries, supplies and depreciation) are assigned to machine set-up cost pool.\n\n\n\ncost pool\nestimated overhead\n\n\n\n\nmachines set up\n$300,000\n\n\nmachining\n$500,000\n\n\ninspecting\n$100,000\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nabc_costs = {\n  'setting_up_machines': 300e3,\n  'machining': 500e3,\n  'inspecting': 100e3\n}\n\n# make a list variable that stores the dictionary values\ndict_list = list( abc_costs.values() )\n# loop through the dictionary values then sum the values and store in variable s\nfor num in dict_list:\n  s = sum( dict_list )\n\nprint(\"Activity cost pool total = $ {:,}\".format(s))\n\n\nActivity cost pool total = $ 900,000.0\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 ABC step 2\nNow the task is to identify the cost drivers for each cost pool. The cost driver must accurately measure the actual consumption of the activity by the various products. To get accurate costing, there needs to be a high degree of correlation between cost driver and consumption of the overhead costs.\n\nactivity cost pool - Setting up machines, Machining, Inspecting\ncost drivers - number of machines set up, machine hours, number of inspection\nexpected use: cost driver - 1,500 machine set ups, 50,000 machine hours and 2,000 inpsections\n\n\n\n5.1.4 ABC step 3\nCalculate the activity based overhead rate per cost driver by dividing the estimated overhead per activity by the number of cost drivers by the number of cost drivers expected to be used.\n\n\nShow the code\n# make a copy of the abc costs\ncost_drivers = abc_costs.copy()\n# add new dictionary keys and values to cost drivers dictionary\ncost_drivers.update( {'expected_machine_setups': 1500} )\ncost_drivers.update( {'expected_machine_hours': 50e3} )\ncost_drivers.update( {'expected_inspections': 2000} )\n\n\nMake a function to calculate the activity based overhead rates.\n\n\nShow the code\n# create a function to calculate the overhead rates\ndef activity_overhead_rates(costing_data: dict):\n  overhead_rates_1 = cost_drivers['setting_up_machines'] / cost_drivers['expected_machine_setups']\n  overhead_rates_2 = cost_drivers['machining'] / cost_drivers['expected_machine_hours']\n  overhead_rates_3 = cost_drivers['inspecting'] / cost_drivers['expected_inspections']\n  \n  print(\"\\n --- Activity Based Overhead Rates --\")\n  print(\"per machine set up\",\".\"*8,\"${:.2f}\".format( overhead_rates_1))\n  print(\"per machine hours\",\".\"*10,\"${:.2f}\".format( overhead_rates_2))\n  print(\"per machine inpections\",\".\"*5,\"${:.2f}\".format( overhead_rates_3))\n\n\n\nactivity_overhead_rates( cost_drivers)\n\n\n\n --- Activity Based Overhead Rates --\nper machine set up ........ $200.00\nper machine hours .......... $10.00\nper machine inpections ..... $50.00\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 ABC step 4\nThis step is about assigning overhead costs, necessary to know the overhead cost driver for each product.

The expected units produced are: item 1 = 200,000 units and item 2 = 80,000 units. This company has annual overhead data available for calculations.\nThis example section uses the library NumPy to do multiple calculations of array vectors (lists) which you have already used in previous sections. This is new information and is not explained, but the use in this section is simply converting a python list into a NumPy array which allows for mathematical operations. So far the functions have been very simple and one by one calculation and this section does all of the math in one step, much like you would using Excel. Python lists cannot do math operations for what we want to do, so knowing and understanding NumPy is important to know for this section alone (NumPy is a huge library for various math operations using array vectors, so just see if you can follow along here).\nThe company overhead data is stored in a data dictionary.\n\n\nShow the code\noverhead_data = {\n  'activity_cost_pools': ['ordering_receiving','machine_setup', 'machining','assembling','inspecting_testing'],\n  \n  'expected_units': {'item_1': 200e3, 'item_2': 80e3},\n  \n  'cost_drivers':{\n    'purchase_orders': 200e3,\n    'set_up': 600e3,\n    'machine_hours': 2e6,\n    'parts': 1.8e6,\n    'tests': 700e3\n    },\n    \n    'expected_use_cost_drivers': {\n      'orders': 2500,\n      'set_ups': 1200,\n      'hours': 800e3,\n      'parts': 3e6,\n      'tests': 35e3\n      },\n      \n     'exp_use_item_1': {\n      'orders': 1000,\n      'set_ups': 500,\n      'hours': 300e3,\n      'parts': 1.8e6,\n      'tests': 20e3\n      },\n      \n      'exp_use_item_2': {\n      'orders': 1500,\n      'set_ups': 700,\n      'hours': 500e3,\n      'parts': 1.2e6,\n      'tests': 15e3\n      }\n}\n\n\nA function that does all of the ABC steps in one step, including the unit cost comparison between the items.

Knowing CVP analysis informs decisions of selling prices, determining product mix and maximizing the use of production facilities.\nThe CVP analysis has some assumptions, such as:\n\nboth costs and revenues are linear throughout the activity\nall costs can be classified with reasonable accuracy as either variable or fixed\nchanges in activity are the only factors that affect costs\ninventory levels stay constant (all units made are sold)\nIf products sold are > 1, Then the sales mix stays constant.

    "text": "6.2 CVP: Income Statement\nCost volume profit income statement classifies costs as variable or fixed and calculates a contribution margin. A contribution margin (CM) is the amount of revenue that remains after variable costs have been deducted (stated as total amount and per-unit basis). This chapter example business is a video production company, the cost data is in a data dictionary.\n\n6.2.1 CVP Break Even\nThe break even point is when the volume of sales matches the quantity of total costs, both variable and fixed, resulting in no income and no loss. Before deciding on introducing a new product or modifying the sales price, it is wise to know the break even analysis. Contribution margin per unit (cmpu).\n\nselling price, variable costs, fixed costs\nbreak_even = fixed_costs / ( price - variable_costs)\ncmpu = price - variable costs\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Target Operating Income\nManagement typically has a set objective for each other product lines, thus target operating income (toi).\n\nrequired_sales_units = (total_fixed_exp + toi) / cmpu\nrequired_sales_dollars = (total_fixed_exp + toi) / cmr\ntarget operating income (before tax)\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Target Income after tax\n\noperating income after tax = target income before tax x (1 - tax rate)\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Contribution margin\n\nrequired sales in units = (fixed costs + target income before tax) / contribution margin per unit\nrequired sales in dollars = (fixed costs + target income before tax) / contribution margin ratio\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Margin of Safety\nThe margin of safety is the difference between actual or expected sales and sales at the break even point, expressed as dollars, units or a ratio. The safety being that even if expected sales fail to be met, the break even range allows for management to have some neutral news. Sales are either actual or expected/\n\nmargin of safety in dollars = sales - break even sales\nmargin of safety ratio = (margin of safety in dollars) / sales\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Sales Mix\nThe sales mix is the relative proportion in which each product is sold when a company sells more than 1 product. For example a company sells printers 80% of the time and 20% is for computers, making the sales mix 80 : 20. To find out the break even sales for a sales mix, the weighted average unit contribution margin of all products needs to be calculated.\n\na company sells 2 items: item 1 sales = 1500, item 2 sales = 500\nitem 1 break even = 1500 / (1500 + 500) == 75%\nitem 2 break even = 500 / (1500 + 500) == 25%\nsales mix is 75 : 25.\n\nweighted average unit contribution margin (waucm)\n\nitem 1 margin percent = (unit contribution margin x sales mix percentage)\nitem 2 margin percent = (unit contribution margin x sales mix percentage)\nwaucm ($) = (item 1 margin percent ) + (item 2 margin percent )\nbreak even point (units) = fixed costs / waucm\n\nAny level of units sold, operating income will be greater if higher contribution margin units are sold, rather than lower contribution margin units.\n\n\n6.2.7 Break even sales\nFor large companies it is best to calculate the break even point in terms of sales dollars and not the number of units sold, using data from the product lines (not individual products).\nCompany has 2 divisions: division 1 and division 2, each division has hundreds of different products items.\n\ndivision 1 = (contribution margin ratio x sales mix percentage)\ndivision 2 = (contribution margin ratio x sales mix percentage)\n`waucm ratio = division 1 + division 2\nbreak even ($) = fixed costs / waucm\n\nbased on the break even point\n\nsales mix: division 1 % : division 2 %\ntotal break even sales k\ndivision 1 total break even = (division 1 % x sales k)\ndivision 2 total break even = (division 2 % x sales k)\n\nIf higher percentage were to occur in one division opposed to another, this would result in higher weighted average contribution margin ratio and a lower break even point."

To establish the standard cost of producing a product, it is essential to create standards for each manufacturing cost element (direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead). Each element is determined from the standard orice to be paid and the standard quantity to be used.\nA company example, Company X makes concentrated caffeinated syrups to be sold and used by beverage serving retail shops.\n\ndirect materials price standard is the cost per unit of direct materials that should be incurred. This standard is based on purchasing department’s best estimate of the cost of raw materials {current purchase price} + {receiving costs, storing costs, handling costs}.\ndirect materials quantity standard is the quantity of direct materials that should be used per unit of finished goods, expressed in units of kg, barrels or liters. The standard should allow for extra amounts of waste or spoilage.\nstandard direct materials cost per unit is standard direct materials price times the standard direct materials quantity\ndirect labor price standard is the rate per hour that should be incurred for direct labor (based on current wages, payroll taxes, benefits). In Canada there is cost of living adjustment COLA.\ndirect labor quantity standard is the time that should be required to make one item unit of the product. Allowances should be made for rest periods, cleanup, machine setup and machine downtime.\nstandard direct labor cost per unit is the direct labor rate times the direct labor hours\n\nCompany X direct material data is in a dictionary.
